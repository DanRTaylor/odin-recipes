    <p>1.20.20 I cooked the shrimp for 10 minutes, and they were overcooked. Temperature at 450ºF definitely is high heat, so next time, I’ll start checking at 7 minutes. It definitely does have a little kick to it, so keep that in mind when making the marinade. We liked it, and I’d make again.</p>
